## Quickshell Config

This is a config that is modular, so that other people can take modules and use them in their own config.

Currently some files in the Components directory are being used in the Bar Module, but I am looking to move away from this so you don't need to dig to get every part of the modules.


# Still deciding:
Make a separate config that isn't modular? Maybe make this one not modular and make a separate modular one?
Globals.qml?
Settings GUI?
Display Manager? (greetd)
Screenshots? (Niri has inbuilt, but other WMs exist)
Border thingy?
Animations?
