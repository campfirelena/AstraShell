## Quickshell Config

This is my quickshell Config, I'm writing this myself because I want this to be perfect for me.

I might add extras so that other people can just put it in, but I have gone back on the modular nature of this so that I can do cool stuff.

# Still deciding:
Globals.qml?
Settings GUI?
Display Manager? (greetd)
Screenshots? (Niri has inbuilt, but other WMs exist)
Border thingy?
Animations?
